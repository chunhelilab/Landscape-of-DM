## Requirements
This code is written in Python 3.7 and require <a href="https://briansimulator.org/" target="_blank">Brian2</a>.

## Reproducing results from the paper
These files reproduce all results from Fig. 2 of the paper Quantifying the landscape of decision making from spiking neural networks 2021.

## Usage Instructions:
1. You can start by running the Simulation.py. This will simulate the spiking neural network for decision making. The simulations is parelelled using multiprocessing package of Python.
